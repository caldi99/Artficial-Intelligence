\section{Requirements}

\begin{flushleft}
In the following section, it is described what are the main libraries and tools used to develop the project. 

For what concerns the software requirements, this project was pretty much developed by the use of :
\begin{itemize}
    \item OpenCV
    \item Tensorflow (GPU version) 
    \item Jupyter Notebook
    \item Nvdia CUDA Toolkit
\end{itemize}

Instead, for the hardware specifications :
\begin{itemize}
    \item GPU : Nvdia GTX 970
    \item RAM : 16 GB
    \item CPU : Intel Core i5 4690
\end{itemize}
