\section{Introduction} 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has significantly affected the daily life activities of people globally.
To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the World Health Organization has recommended people to wear face masks in public places.
Manual inspection of people for wearing face masks in public places is a challenging task.
This introduces an urgent need to develop a system capable of detecting the people not wearing the face masks in a simple and autonomous way. For this reason we develop a system that can recognize if a person is wearing a face mask using Deep learning and OpenCV libraries.
