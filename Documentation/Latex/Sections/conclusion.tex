\section{Conclusion} 

This paper has presented a framework for accurate face mask detection and masked facial recognition.
This model for face mask detection and masked facial recognition with a good accuracy under diverse conditions i.e., variations in face angles,
lightning conditions, gender, skin tone, age, types of masks, occlusions (glasses), etc. 
The proposed method can be utilized for a variety of purposes including the safety of the people. 

\section{Future works}
Since our model is heavy, also the fine-tuned one, it is possible that not all the device are able to compute it in a reasonable amount of time, In order to develop a program that may be used in a more heterogeneous amount of device we have found other models, thinner than Resnet50, that may be implemented to scan face faster. This model is called MobileN.
