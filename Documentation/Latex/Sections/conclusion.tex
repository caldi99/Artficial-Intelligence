\section{Conclusion} 

Future works:
Since our model is heavy, also the fine-tuned one, it is possible that not all the device are able to compute it in a reasonable amount of time, In order to develop a program that may be used in a more heterogeneous amount of device we have found other models, thinner than Resnet50, that may be implemented to scan face faster. This model is called MobileN.
