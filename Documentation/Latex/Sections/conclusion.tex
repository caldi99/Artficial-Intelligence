\section{Conclusion} 

We have seen that our model works with a very good score both in train and test model, the ResnetV2 framework is powerful but heavy
\section{Future works}
Since our model is heavy, also the fine-tuned one, it is possible that not all the device are able to compute it in a reasonable amount of time, In order to develop a program that may be used in a more heterogeneous amount of device we have found other models, thinner than Resnet50, that may be implemented to scan face faster. This model is called MobileN.
