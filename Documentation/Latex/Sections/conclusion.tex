\section{Conclusion} 

This paper has presented a framework for accurate face mask detection and masked facial recognition.
This model for face mask detection and masked facial recognition has a good accuracy under diverse conditions i.e., variations in face angles,
lightning conditions, gender, skin tone, age, types of masks, occlusions (glasses), etc. 
The proposed method can be utilized for a variety of purposes and can be integrated with other tools (like instruments for measuring body temperature) in order to maximize the safety of people. 

\section{Future works}
Since our model is heavy, also the fine-tuned one, it is possible that not all the devices are able to compute it in a reasonable amount of time. In order to develop a program that may be used in a more heterogeneous amount of device we have found other models, thinner than Resnet50, that may be implemented to scan faces faster. This model is called MobileN.
